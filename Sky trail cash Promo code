Repairing a leaky roof (or some other home system or major appliance): Letting it go for too long will lead to more damage and higher costs, so the sooner you fix it, the better.
Car maintenance that keeps you safe: Driving in a vehicle that needs new brakes or tires is unsafe. You’ll want to make those repairs quickly, especially if you need your car to get to work or school.
Bills that piled up during a period of no income: Carrying high-interest debt might be weighing down your finances. If you qualify for a lower-rate emergency loan, you could save money and pay off your debt faster.
Emergency dental work: Even with dental insurance, dentist bills can be high. Working out a payment plan with the office might be the best route, but an emergency loan could work well if that option isn’t available.
Travel for family obligations: There might be times when you need to be with your family even if your budget doesn’t allow for it. For example, you may need to visit a sick loved one or attend a funeral.
